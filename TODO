x Data entry
x Display reports
x Add zip code to reports for maps?
x Authentication (add restrictions; a login system is in place).
x Add select2 for school select box for data entry. (Just used a regular select instead. There aren't that many schools.)
x Report model isn't saving zip code data.
x Enter report data
x School district and board member contact
x Check for spam (guid in cookie?)
x Total stats
x Graphs/etc.
- Also make the data zip code searchable? (Decided not to. Most will be searching by school. Could implement this later as a point of interest.)
- Show hot spots on the home page with the most cases reported in the last N days. (Not really relevant. Most will be interested in school-specific info.)
o Data export in case people want to crunch the data themselves.
o Add search for schools/dates to home page.
o Make case tables filterable (using DataColumn or GridView?) on the School and Board Member pages?
o Other content (about/etc.)
o Style
